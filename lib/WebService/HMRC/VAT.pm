=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl module to interact with the UK's HMRC Making Tax Digital
`VAT` API. This allows VAT returns to be submitted or viewed,
and obligations, payments and liabilities to be viewed.

For more information, see:
L<https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0>

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing

=head1 PROPERTIES

Inherits from L<WebService::HMRC::Request>.

=head2 vrn

VAT registration number for which records are being queries or submitted.
Required parameter for initialisation.

The VAT registration number must be purely numeric, without any spaces or
GB prefix.

=cut

has vrn => (
   is => 'rw',
   isa => 'Int',
   required => 1,
);

=head1 METHODS

Inherits from L<WebService::HMRC::Request>.

=head2 obligations({ from => 'YYYY-MM-DD', to => 'YYYY-MM-DD', [status => $status, ] [test_mode => $test_mode] })

Retrieve a set of VAT filing obligations for the specified date range. Returns
a WebService::HMRC::Response object reference. Requires permission for the
C<read:vat> service scope.

=head3 Parameters

=over

=item from

Return obligations from this date, specified as YYYY-MM-DD.
Required parameter.

=item to

Return obligations up to this date, specified as YYYY-MM-DD.
Required parameter.

=item status

Optional parameter to filter the obligations returned. May be set to 'O' to
return only 'open' obligations, or 'F' to return only 'fulfilled' obligations.

Default is to return all obligations, both fulfilled and open.

=item test_mode

Optional parameter used only for testing against the HMRC sandbox api.

This parameter should not be used in production systems - it causes dummy
test data to be returned.

By default, when testing against the sandbox with no C<test_mode> specified,
the test api simulates the scenario where the client has quarterly
obligations and one is fulfilled

Other test scenarios are available by setting the C<test_mode> parameter
as detailed below:

C<QUARTERLY_NONE_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has quarterly
obligations and none are fulfilled.

C<QUARTERLY_ONE_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has quarterly
obligations and one is fulfilled.

C<QUARTERLY_TWO_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has quarterly
obligations and two are fulfilled.

C<QUARTERLY_THREE_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has quarterly
obligations and three are fulfilled.

C<QUARTERLY_FOUR_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has quarterly
obligations and four are fulfilled.

C<MONTHLY_NONE_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has monthly
obligations and none are fulfilled.

C<MONTHLY_ONE_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has monthly
obligations and one month is fulfilled.

C<MONTHLY_TWO_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has monthly
obligations and two months are fulfilled.

C<MONTHLY_THREE_MET> simulates the scenario where the client has monthly
obligations and three months are fulfilled.

C<NOT_FOUND> simulates the scenario where no data is found.

=head3 Response Data

For full details of the response data, see the HMRC API specification. In summary,
the data contains a single element `obligations` pointing to an array of
VAT return obligations:

    {
      obligations => [

=head1 AUTHORISATION

Access to the HMRC Making Tax Digital VAT APIs requires that an application
be registered with HMRC and enabled for this service. Additionally permission
must be granted by a registered user for the application to access the
C<read:vat> or C<write:vat> service scope, as noted for each method.

Authorisation is provided by means of an C<access token>.

For more details on obtaining and using access tokens, See
L<WebService::HMRC::Authenticate>.

Further information, application credentials and documentation may be obtained
from the
L<HMRC Developer Hub|https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation>.

=head1 TESTING

The basic tests are run as part of the installation instructions shown above
use an invalid uri as an endpoint. This tests basic interaction with the
module's method and does not require an internet connection.

Developer pre-release tests may be run with the following command:

    prove -l xt/

With a working internet connection, HMRC application credentials and an access
token granted by a test user enrolled for the Making Tax Digital for Business
VAT service, interaction with the real HMRC sandbox api can be tested. The
test user's VAT registration number must also be provided.
